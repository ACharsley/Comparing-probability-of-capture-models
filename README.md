# SDM-comparisons

This repository provides all the code and data used for the analyses described in:

Charsley, A.R., Nokuthaba, S., Hoyle, S.D., Crow, S.K., Comparing machine learning, spatio-temporal modelling, and Gaussian process modelling for estimating the distribution of freshwater fish. In preparation for Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

Data from the River Environment Classification (REC) were too large to be uploaded to this repository. Instead, data can be found here:
